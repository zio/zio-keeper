ZIO Keeper is a purely-functional, type-safe library for building distributed
systems. 

It provides numerous primitives for tackling the common problems in distributed
computing (e.g. leader election, cluster forming etc.). Under the hood, the
library is backed by [ZIO][Link-ZIO] and [ZIO NIO][Link-NIO], profiting from their
performant, type and resource-safe APIs.

- **Composable**. Design complex systems by composing the available building blocks.
- **Resilient**. Build apps with automated failure recovery.
- **Secure**. Benefit from security guarantees built into the library core.
